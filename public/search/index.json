[{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re aiming to 100% complete No Man’s Sky—including all in-game milestones, achievements (including Survival and Permadeath), and trophy/platinum rewards—here\u0026rsquo;s the most reliable route based on the latest 2025 version of the game:\n🎯 1. Plan Your Game Mode\rStart in Permadeath with default Permadeath settings (no Survival or Relaxed customization)—doing so unlocks both the Survival and Permadeath milestone achievements simultaneously once you reach the centre of the galaxy or complete the Atlas storyline (Reddit). You can optionally customize other difficulty parameters while preserving Permadeath mode; this won’t disqualify the save (Reddit, Reddit). ✅ 2. Milestones \u0026amp; Achievements to Cover\rThere are 27 total Steam/PlayStation achievements (or platform-specific variants), spanning:\nMain milestones like alien encounters, words learned, exploration, wealth, combat, survival time, etc. (Reddit).\nExamples include:\nClaim a base or buy a freighter (Cradle) Build an Exocraft (Navigators) Visit another player\u0026rsquo;s base and interact with their base computer (Reunion) (TrueAchievements). Discover all fauna on a single planet (“A Scanner Darkly”) Walk a massive amount (“Symphony For A Lost Traveler”) (Steam Community). 🧠 The Steam Community guide outlines all 27 achievements with estimated 50–75 hours gameplay, possibly requiring two playthroughs—but you can do it in one Permadeath run (TrueAchievements).\n🚀 3. Speedrunning Tips \u0026amp; Efficiency Tricks\rLearn the first glyph, locate a Portal, and use the all‑first‑glyph address to warp within a few jumps to the galactic centre—this massively speeds up the Survival/Permadeath run (can finish in less than an hour if well prepared) (Reddit).\nUse portable refiner duplication, gather life‑support gel and batteries early, avoid sentinel combat, secure a Minotaur Exocraft, and use the Anomaly to get the hyperdrive‑range ship and blueprint upgrades (Reddit).\nBuild a base computer near the portal you’ll revisit to streamline travel later in the game (Reddit).\n🌱 4. Fully Complete Discoveries \u0026amp; World Scanning\rTo get the “Discover all creatures on one planet” milestone, thoroughly scan every biome (surface, cave, air), including cave marrow plants and multiple fauna variants—even if they look identical (Reddit). Don’t just walk—scan fauna and flora, then upload discoveries (especially fauna on 10 separate planets) to ensure the Archivist / Zoologist achievements register (Reddit). Interact with other players’ base computers to unlock the Reunion achievement—make sure you save/reload if it doesn’t trigger the first time (Steam Community). 🧾 5. What’s Actually Achievable?\rExpeditions mode can unlock most DLC trophies and the platinum—but for clarity and control, many recommend using a clean Permadeath run rather than expeditions, unless you\u0026rsquo;re experienced (PlayStation Trophies). Some elements—like legacy blueprints tied to old versions or tech—are no longer obtainable, and your catalogue might display “????” slots that aren’t possible to fill in the latest version (Reddit). However, for all current-century achievements and most DLC content available in 2025, you can reliably reach 100% status. 🛠️ 6. Your Roadmap: Quick Checklist\rNew save → Permadeath default settings. Basic tutorials → repair ship → get warp capabilities. Interact with Base Computer → start building a base. Build Exocraft (e.g. Minotaur), gather resources, avoid Sentinel threats. Scan and upload fauna/flora on multiple planets. Learn languages → collect glyphs → locate Portal. Use glyph‑only Portal travel to reach the centre quickly. Visit Anomaly, interact with other players’ bases for Reunion. Accumulate milestones: words, species interactions, exploration, units, kills. Upload discoveries, build fleets (ships, frigates), craft all upgrades as feasible. Track milestones in‑game (Milestones tab). Save often and back up your save. 💬 Community Wisdom\r“If you do the permadeath centre achievement you also get the survivor one at the same time.” “Find a traveler, learn the first glyph, find a portal. Address = all first glyph. This will take you very close to the centre…” “You can do it once in permadeath and you will get them both.” (Reddit, Reddit, Reddit, Reddit, Steam Community)\n📌 TL;DR\rBest path: Permadeath run with default settings → reach galaxy centre or complete Atlas → unlock Survival + Permadeath achievements simultaneously. Cover the full list of 27 achievements and all milestones by scanning, uploading, building, exploring. Use portal skip, community base visits, exocraft strategy—most players finish in under 100 hours total. Some legacy content remains unobtainable—but every achievement currently supported in 2025 is earnable. Happy travels, Traveller!
