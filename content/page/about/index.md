### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m **Narnacle**. I created this blog as free alternative to my [medium](https://howto100.medium.com)

I usually post about interesting topics I stumble upon, particularly in areas like [Gaming](../../tags/gaming), [Achievements](../../tags/achievements), and [Trophies](../../tags/trophies).

If you enjoy my content, consider supporting me with a [donation](../../donate).

## Current Projects

Hereâ€™s what I'm currently working on:

1. **[No Man's Sky](../../post/how-to-100-no-mans-sky)** - 100% completing No Manâ€™s Sky is totally possible if you optimize for efficiency, shortcuts, and automation â€” especially since the game has evolved massively over the years..
2. **[Hogwarts Legcay](.)**- 100% completing Hogwarts Legacy means fully finishing all main story content, side quests, collectibles, challenges, and trophies/achievements.
