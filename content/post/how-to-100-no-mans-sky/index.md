If you're aiming to **100% complete No Man’s Sky**—including all **in-game milestones**, **achievements (including Survival and Permadeath)**, and **trophy/platinum rewards**—here's the most reliable route based on the latest 2025 version of the game:

---

## 🎯 1. Plan Your Game Mode

* **Start in Permadeath with default Permadeath settings (no Survival or Relaxed customization)**—doing so **unlocks both the Survival and Permadeath milestone achievements** simultaneously once you reach the centre of the galaxy or complete the Atlas storyline ([Reddit][1]).
* You can optionally **customize other difficulty parameters** while preserving Permadeath mode; this won’t disqualify the save ([Reddit][2], [Reddit][3]).

---

## ✅ 2. Milestones & Achievements to Cover

There are **27 total Steam/PlayStation achievements** (or platform-specific variants), spanning:

* Main milestones like alien encounters, words learned, exploration, wealth, combat, survival time, etc. ([Reddit][4]).
* Examples include:

  * **Claim a base or buy a freighter** (Cradle)
  * **Build an Exocraft** (Navigators)
  * **Visit another player's base** and interact with their base computer (Reunion) ([TrueAchievements][5]).
  * **Discover all fauna on a single planet** (“A Scanner Darkly”)
  * **Walk a massive amount** (“Symphony For A Lost Traveler”) ([Steam Community][6]).

🧠 The Steam Community guide outlines all 27 achievements with estimated 50–75 hours gameplay, possibly requiring two playthroughs—but you can do it in one Permadeath run ([TrueAchievements][5]).

---

## 🚀 3. Speedrunning Tips & Efficiency Tricks

* Learn the **first glyph**, locate a Portal, and use the **all‑first‑glyph address** to warp within a few jumps to the galactic centre—this massively **speeds up the Survival/Permadeath run** (can finish in less than an hour if well prepared) ([Reddit][3]).

* Use **portable refiner duplication**, gather life‑support gel and batteries early, **avoid sentinel combat**, secure a **Minotaur Exocraft**, and use the **Anomaly** to get the hyperdrive‑range ship and blueprint upgrades ([Reddit][3]).

* Build a base computer near the portal you’ll revisit to streamline travel later in the game ([Reddit][3]).

---

## 🌱 4. Fully Complete Discoveries & World Scanning

* To get the **“Discover all creatures on one planet”** milestone, thoroughly scan **every biome** (surface, cave, air), including cave marrow plants and multiple fauna variants—even if they look identical ([Reddit][7]).
* Don’t just walk—**scan fauna and flora**, then **upload discoveries** (especially fauna on 10 separate planets) to ensure the **Archivist / Zoologist achievements** register ([Reddit][8]).
* Interact with **other players’ base computers** to unlock the Reunion achievement—make sure you save/reload if it doesn’t trigger the first time ([Steam Community][9]).

---

## 🧾 5. What’s Actually Achievable?

* **Expeditions mode** can unlock most DLC trophies and the platinum—but for clarity and control, many recommend using a **clean Permadeath run** rather than expeditions, unless you're experienced ([PlayStation Trophies][10]).
* Some elements—like legacy blueprints tied to old versions or tech—are **no longer obtainable**, and your catalogue might display “????” slots that aren’t possible to fill in the latest version ([Reddit][11]).
* However, for all **current-century** achievements and most DLC content available in 2025, you can reliably reach 100% status.

## 🛠️ 6. Your Roadmap: Quick Checklist

1. New save → **Permadeath default settings**.
2. Basic tutorials → repair ship → get warp capabilities.
3. Interact with **Base Computer** → start building a base.
4. Build **Exocraft** (e.g. Minotaur), gather resources, avoid Sentinel threats.
5. Scan and upload fauna/flora on multiple planets.
6. Learn languages → collect glyphs → locate Portal.
7. Use glyph‑only Portal travel to reach the centre quickly.
8. Visit **Anomaly**, interact with other players’ bases for Reunion.
9. Accumulate milestones: words, species interactions, exploration, units, kills.
10. Upload discoveries, build fleets (ships, frigates), craft all upgrades as feasible.
11. Track milestones in‑game (Milestones tab).
12. Save often and back up your save.

### 💬 Community Wisdom

> “If you do the permadeath centre achievement you also get the survivor one at the same time.”
> “Find a traveler, learn the first glyph, find a portal. Address = all first glyph. This will take you very close to the centre…”
> “You can do it once in permadeath and you will get them both.”
> ([Reddit][12], [Reddit][3], [Reddit][13], [Reddit][14], [Steam Community][9])

### 📌 TL;DR

* Best path: **Permadeath run with default settings** → reach galaxy centre or complete Atlas → unlock Survival + Permadeath achievements simultaneously.
* Cover the full list of 27 achievements and all milestones by scanning, uploading, building, exploring.
* Use portal skip, community base visits, exocraft strategy—**most players finish in under 100 hours total**.
* Some legacy content remains unobtainable—but every achievement currently supported in 2025 is earnable.
